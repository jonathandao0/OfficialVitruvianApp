This was the App I developed for my FRC Team 4201 for the 2015 competition season.

This app utilizes Parse as its cloud database.

Since this was the first year we tried developing the App, it had a lot of problems, leaving us to ultimately use pen & paper for most of our actual scouting. So this code is more for reference/learning than for actual use.
